nfsize
----------

This is basically just a little project for learning purposes dealing mainly
with the passing of addresses and dealing with multiple pointer indirection,
and Linux file I/O.

`nfsize' takes files and/or directories as command line arguments and
calculates their size in bytes, or in the case of a directory,
how many items it contains.

Sort of useful for quickly viewing a file's size (converted to KB, MB, or GB
instead of plain bytes) within a console.
