Simple Shell Toolkit
---------

To build and install, from this directory run:
    ./build && ./build install && ./build clean

eq -> equal
ne -> not equal
gt -> greater than
ge -> greater than or equal to
lt -> less than
le -> less than or equal to

These are meant to be used from the command line or in scripts with control statements such as *if* and *while*.

The 2 programs *eq* and *ne* can be used with numerical values as well as string values, while the rest are only for numerical values.

Examples:
    VAR1=hello
    VAR2=world
    COUNT=0
    NUM=14

    if eq hello $VAR1; then
      echo "hello == $VAR1"
    fi
    if ne $VAR1 $VAR2; then
      echo "$VAR1 != $VAR2"
    fi
    while lt $COUNT $NUM; do
      echo "$COUNT"
      (( COUNT++ ))
    done
